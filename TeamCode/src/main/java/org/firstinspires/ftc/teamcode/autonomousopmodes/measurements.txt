Time taken to move 1 metre forward/backward @ 0.2 power: X seconds
Time taken to move 1 metre right/left @ 0.2 power: X seconds

Time needed to rotate 90 degrees @ 0.2 power: X seconds

Distance moved forward in 2 seconds @ 0.2 power: 1870 millimetres
Distance moved right in 2 seconds @ 0.2 power: 1560 millimetres

THEREFORE: 749 milliseconds to move one tile horizontally, and 625 milliseconds to move one tile vertically
