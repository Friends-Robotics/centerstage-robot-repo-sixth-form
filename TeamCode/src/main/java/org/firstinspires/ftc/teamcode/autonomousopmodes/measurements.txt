Outer diameter of mecanum wheel = d = 96mm
Circumference of mecanum wheel = C = 96mm * PI

Encoder ticks for a full revolution of one mecanum wheel = T = to be calculated

therefore, moving every wheel by T encoder ticks causes the robot to move C millimeters forward

therefore, T/C encoder ticks is 1mm of movement
