Distance moved forward in 2 seconds @ 0.4 power: 1870 millimetres RECALCULATE
Distance moved right in 2 seconds @ 0.4 power: 1560 millimetres RECALCULATE

(milliseconds to move one tile) = (23" in millimetres = 584.2) * 2 / (millimetres moved in two seconds) * 1000

THEREFORE: 749 milliseconds to move one tile horizontally, and 625 milliseconds to move one tile vertically

Important playing field measurements:
